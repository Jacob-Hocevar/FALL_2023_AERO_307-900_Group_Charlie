# Data for the Fall 2023 AERO 307-900 Lab Group Charlie
The report for Group Lab 2 ("Lab #5: Torsional Dynamics Plant") requested all measured data, which totals around 100k data points. Therefore, we decided to upload them in a standard format. Simply open the corresponding folder and inspect the .csv files. The naming convention specifies the voltage applied to the motor; e.g., 0.8V_data corresponds to 0.8 V applied.
